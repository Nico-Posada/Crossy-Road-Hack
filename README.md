# Crossy Road Hack

**UPDATE**
- Heavily cleaned up code and (hopefully) made it much more readable
- Figured out how coins are encrypted in memory, so there's now a set coin option
- Spent a hell of a lot of time figuring out how setting high scores work too, so now theres that too lol

External Crossy Road Hack that I put together that utilized different unique methods to get stuff done. Can be used to get instant max score immediately on jump, set coin value, and set high score for any mode in the game.

# USAGE
Compile in x86 Release mode, run it and make sure Crossy Road is open (:
