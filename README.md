# Crossy Road Hack

**IMPORTANT INFO PLEASE READ**
I'm not sure when, but recently Crossy Road was taken off of the Microsoft Store. This means that you can only use this if you had it downloaded before they took it down. I'll be keeping this repository up as a sort of legacy type thing.

**UPDATE v2**
- Added an unlock all feature, there's no reverting just yet but might add it later

**UPDATE**
- Heavily cleaned up code and (hopefully) made it much more readable
- Figured out how coins are encrypted in memory, so there's now a set coin option
- Spent a hell of a lot of time figuring out how setting high scores work too, so now theres that too lol

External Crossy Road Hack that I put together that utilizes different unique methods to get stuff done. Can be used to get max score instantly on jump, set coin value, set high score for any mode in the game, and even unlock every character in the game. I feel I may have completed everything important that there is to figure out so I might take a break from the game for now, but we'll see what happens...

# USAGE
Compile in x86 Release mode, run it and make sure Crossy Road is open (:
