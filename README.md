# Crossy-Road-Hack-Code-Cave
Quick external Crossy Road trainer I made that modifies the function used to add points to your score and forces it to add 9999 to your score every time you move up. Includes a memory driver that has signature scanning and a method to fetch the base address for games that get handled by dll's (ie. Crossy Road.exe is the main exe, but everything gets handled by Crossy Road.dll).
